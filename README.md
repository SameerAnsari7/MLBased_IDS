Developed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Machine Learning Algorithms for Enhanced Security

# ML-Based Intrusion Detection System

Welcome to the ML-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project! This application leverages machine learning algorithms to enhance security by detecting potential intrusions in network traffic. Built with Python and Flask, it provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and alerts.

## Features

### Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Random Forest (RF)**: Achieved an impressive accuracy of **98%** in detecting intrusions.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Achieved a high accuracy of **95%** for intrusion classification.

### User Interface
- **Intuitive UI**: Users can easily interact with the IDS, view alerts, and analyze potential threats.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: For implementing the machine learning models and backend logic.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Flask**: To create a web application and handle user requests.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For building the frontend interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SameerAnsari7/MLBased_IDS.git
   cd MLBased_IDS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

### Usage

1. **Monitor Network Traffic**: The IDS will analyze incoming data and detect potential intrusions based on the trained models.
2. **View Alerts**: Users can view alerts in the UI, detailing any suspicious activity detected by the system.
